# Image-Based Breed Recognition

This project aims to identify cattle breeds from images using deep learning. Upload an image of a cow, and the model predicts the most likely breed with high accuracy.

##  Features

- Identify cattle breeds from photos
- Trained deep learning model (e.g. CNN)
- Potential for web-based image upload and prediction
- Extendable for more breeds or improved models

## How It Works (Expected Flow)

1. **Data Collection**: Cattle images labeled by breed.
2. **Model Training**: CNN or transfer learning model trained on labeled dataset.
3. **Prediction**: Trained model predicts breed from unseen image input.
4. **Evaluation**: Accuracy measured, errors analyzed via confusion matrix.
